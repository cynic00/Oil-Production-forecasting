In the field of petroleum engineering, one of the primary responsibilities of a reservoir
engineer is the ability to quantify the reservoirâ€™s performance. This is performed using
decline curve analysis (DCA), where the production rates are monitored against time, and
predictions are made on oil or gas volumes, which can be produced by the reservoir.
With the increased adoption of machine learning-based solutions in the oil and gas industry,
there has been an effort to improve decline curve analysis to make more accurate forecasts.
So in this project, apart from the conventional Arps equations used for decline curve analysis,
time series-based forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM is also done.
